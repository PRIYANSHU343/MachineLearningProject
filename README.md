# AI Accelerated Digital Twin Using Machine Learning

This is a real-world client-facing project that consists of data analysis, visualization, machine learning, and automated pattern recognition using time series data from measurements of air quality sensors.A dynamic Infrastructure Using Digital Twin Integrated with Machine Learning Model to help optimize and manage the supply lines. Moreover presented to the consumers using familiar power technologies.
In this project, I have developed a robust adoption strategy for Digital Twins, leveraging the integration of cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), data analysis, and dynamic modeling. The primary focus has been on utilizing Digital Twins to optimize and simulate real-world supply chain scenarios. The project aims to bring substantial value to supply chain management by providing actionable insights derived from real-time data. The objective of this digital twin project is to monitor and assess air quality in a factory environment using a combination of sensors, IoT devices, and machine learning models. The project employs various Azure services, including IoT Hub, Stream Analytics, ML Studio, Digital Twin, Power BI, and Blob Storage. The focus is on creating a digital twin model that provides real-time insights into air quality parameters.!

I have created below Notebooks for Furthur details

Point Anomaly Detection: This notebook show how to detect the point anomalies (outliers) and automatically flags them.

Collective Anomaly Detection: This notebook shows how to detect the collective anomalies (patterns) by training Regression models using sliding window and forward chaining on the time series data.
